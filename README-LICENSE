Can choose to follow either MIT or Unlicense; MIT made available in case
Unlicense does not legally apply in your jurisdiction.

Note: the two "lib_extern/babylon_*" files are from an external source
(the BabylonJS library) and thus the MIT+Unlicense of the rest of this
repo does not apply to those two files.
